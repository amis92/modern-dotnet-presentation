# Modern .NET

How to benefit from .NET Core, .NET Standard, MSBuild v15+, `dotnet` CLI, Sdk-style `.csproj`, .NET Local/Global Tools and a hint of what's coming.

<!--
Remind people to install .NET Core SDK (v2.2, check if they have Visual Studio Code, Omnisharp extension)

# What is all that about

It's about having a:
- Cross-platform,
- Open-source,
- Community-inclusive,
- and just simply *awesome*

# .NET Core

- Since November 2014
- Cross-platform
- No .NET Framework compatibility
- Supercharged (many back-compat bugs fixed)

---

# .NET Standard

- Portable Class Libraries were: complicated, thin-spread, problematic for targeting and poorly designed (as intersections of existing implementations)
- Streamlining API levels (backported for 1.x)
  - 1.0 - 1.6 (created for .NET Core 1.0)
  - 2.0 (.NET Framework 4.6.1+, .NET Core 2.0)
  - 2.1 *WIP* (.NET Core 3.0, âš  no Framework support)

---

# .NET Standard support

<!--
source: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/standard/net-standard

The following table lists the minimum platform versions that support each .NET Standard version. That means that later versions of a listed platform also support the corresponding .NET Standard version. For example, .NET Core 2.2 supports .NET Standard 2.0 and earlier.

# MSBuild 15+

- [Cross-platform](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/msbuild-is-going-cross-platform-with-net-core/)
- Integrated with `dotnet` âž¡ `dotnet msbuild`
- Supports:
  - `<PackageReference />` NuGet references with transient dependency support
  - Sdk-style `.csproj`
  - Cross-targeting (multi-targeting)
  - Wildcards: `Include="**/*.cs"`

<!--

# Sdk-style `csproj`

- [PR introducing Sdk-style `.csproj` to `Uno.Inventory.Software.Server`](https://ivanti.visualstudio.com/Uno/_git/Inventory.Software.Server/pullrequest/25602?_a=overview)
- 227 file changes:
  - 11 âž•
  - 137 âž–
  - 77 edits
  - 2 renames

# `dotnet` CLI

- Cross-platform, runs on .NET Core, extensible
- Supports `new`, `build`, `run` and more actions
- Single point of truth about .NET Core system-wide
- Supports Local and Global Tools

---

# `dotnet` CLI Tools

- [Deprecated "Per-project" tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/pl-pl/dotnet/core/tools/extensibility#per-project-based-extensibility)
- [Replaced with Sdk v3.0 Local Tools](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/107)
- Global Tools installed via `dotnet`:
  - e.g. `dotnet tool install -g dotnetsay`
- Local and Global tools are the same package, installed differently

---

# Example of possibilities

- [`Amadevus.RecordGenerator`](https://amis92.github.io/RecordGenerator/)
- [`wham` library](https://github.com/WarHub/wham/) - massive code generation

---

# What's to come

- .NET Core 3.0 (.NET Standard 2.1) - September 2019
  - Local Tools
  - EF 6.3
- C# 8.0
  - NNRTs (Non-Nullable Reference Types) - `string?`
  - Default implementations in interfaces
  - Index and Range `array[0..array.Length-1]`
- And in 2021 - [**.NET 5**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-5/)
